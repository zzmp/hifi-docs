* If you create a Voxel and want to undo use Ctrl+Z
* A great location to learn how to build and not worry about making any mistakes is on the Sandbox. To get there type '@' then 'sandbox'

# Basic Setup

## OS X: Revealing the Library directory

Snapshots and Logs are saved to _Users>Username>Library>Application Support>Interface_

Recent versions of OSX hide the Library directory/folder by default, and it must be enabled through the Terminal with this command: `"chflags nohidden ~/Library/“`

If you prefer a less permanent way to go to the User Library folder:
Finder --> Go --> press the Alt key --> then you can select the Library folder

## OS X: Setting up FaceShift

1. Load fsHighFidelity
2. If multiple sensor drivers are available, choose Openni 2.0 Sensor Plugin. 
3. Follow the instructions to run through the training, build, and save your profile.
4. Enable Network Streaming under Tracking>Network>Faceshift Network
5. Enable Faceshift (TCP) in Interface under Developer>Avatar Options

## OS X: Setting up the Razer Hydra

1. Download the Sixense SDK from http://sixense.com/hardware/sixensesdk
2. Copy lib/osx_x64/release_dll/libsixense_x64.dylib to Applications/Interface/Contents/Frameworks 

## OS X: Setting up the Oculus Rift

_We're currently working on adding the needed resources to the installer to enable Rift mode._

# Troubleshooting

## OS X: "Interface cannot be opened because of a problem" after update to Build 148

Build 148 won't run without the Sixense SDK installed in the Frameworks folder as described above under "Setting up the Razer Hydra".
