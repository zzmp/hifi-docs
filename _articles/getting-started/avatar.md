Frequently Asked Questions for HiFi non-developers

### What platforms are currently supported?
HiFi is supported on Windows, OSX, and Linux.

### What VR support is available?
- **Headsets**: Oculus Rift will be supported shortly.
- **Facial**: Facial features tracking using standard webcams is available using the Visage FaceTrack plug-in. Higher resolution facial features tracking is available from faceshift.   
- **Hands**: Input support is available for Razer Hydra.  

### Why do in-world avatars look flat and blocky?
The client will attempt to drop avatar detail until your frame rate is above 30. If it can't do that, then all avatars will appear as billboards.

### Are there any pre-made avatars?
Yes! Go to Edit/Preferences and click on the magnifying glass icons next to the "Head" and "Body" URLs. You should see a dialog allowing you to choose from a set of preexisting models.
