### .fst File

* Stores the mapping the **Faceshift** rig and **FBX** rig.
* Located at **/Documents/faceshift/targets**

### faceshift target mapping file

* name= [The **name** of the FBX file]
* filename=[The **path** the FBX file]
* texdir=[The **path** to the texture directory]
* scale=[The **scale** of the model (depends on source model)]
* Default rotational and translation information are set = 0 (e.g. rx=0...tx=0...)

### Joints 

* jointEyeLeft = jointEyeLeft = 1
* jointEyeRight = jointEyeRight = 1
* jointNeck = jointNeck = 1 (maps to the neck joint at base of head)
* Note: JointNeckRoot is mapped by default and corresponds to base of neck
